# Deployment

## Tools and Technologies

- **Docker**: Containerize the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL for consistent and portable deployment.
- **NGINX**: Acts as a reverse proxy to serve the frontend and backend efficiently.
- **GitHub Pages / AWS**: Options for hosting the application. GitHub Pages can be used for static frontend hosting, while AWS provides a scalable solution for both frontend and backend.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Containerization**:

   - Create Dockerfiles for the frontend, backend, and database.
   - Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

2. **Reverse Proxy Setup**:

   - Configure NGINX to route requests to the appropriate services (frontend or backend).

3. **Hosting**:

   - For GitHub Pages:
     - Build the frontend and push the static files to the `gh-pages` branch.
   - For AWS:
     - Use services like Elastic Beanstalk or EC2 for backend deployment.
     - Use S3 and CloudFront for frontend hosting.

4. **Database Configuration**:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is properly configured and accessible within the Docker network.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the deployment locally using Docker Compose.
   - Verify the deployment on the chosen hosting platform.
