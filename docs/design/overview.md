        Add subtle animations for adding, removing, or updating tasks using libraries like react-spring or Framer Motion.

üõ† Tech Stack
Frontend:

    React with TypeScript: Build the user interface.
    Ant Design: Create a polished and responsive UI.
    Redux Toolkit: Manage global state (e.g., user, projects, and tasks).
    Vite: Fast development and build tool.
    Figma: Design the app layout and user experience.

Backend:

    FastAPI: Build the RESTful API service.
    PostgreSQL: Store user, project, and task data.
    SQLAlchemy: ORM for database operations.
    Celery (Optional): Schedule background tasks for notifications.
    Redis (Optional): Task queue for Celery.

Deployment:

    Docker: Use Docker containers for the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL.
    NGINX: Serve the frontend and backend.
    GitHub Pages/ AWS: Deploy the app.

üèó Architecture Overview

    Frontend:
        React app connects to the FastAPI backend via REST APIs.
        Ant Design components are used for UI elements like forms, tables, and modals.

    Backend:
        FastAPI handles user authentication (JWT/OAuth2), project, and task management endpoints.
        Task due reminders and notifications are sent using Celery.

    Database:
        PostgreSQL stores user, project, and task data.
        Use SQLAlchemy to define models and perform database queries.

üé® Figma Design Ideas

    User Interface Pages:
        Login/Sign-Up Page: Clean and simple form with Ant Design components.
        Dashboard: Display an overview of all projects, tasks, and notifications.
        Project Page: List all tasks in a project with filtering and sorting options.
        Task Details Modal: Show task details with edit/delete options.

    Color Palette:
        Use a professional color scheme (e.g., blue, white, and gray for light mode; dark blue and black for dark mode).

    Typography:
        Use Ant Design's typography components for consistency.

    Responsive Design:
        Create mockups for web and mobile views.
